This python code finds the best possible path between A and B point.
Running the code, you are greeted with a 50x50 grid, where your first left click will be the start and second left click will be the end node.
Anything after those clicks are considered barriers and marked with black color.
After defining the start and end nodes, pressing the key SPACE will start the pathfinding.
Pressing the letter C will reset the program without exiting it.
Right clicking will reset a single node.
